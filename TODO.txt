Code and package structure is very haphazard. Code needs some significant changes

Implement following weapons:

Proper Javelin behavior
Proper dagger behavior. as of now it is only a meele weapon.
Throwing knives - needs rework. Probably not going to even bother to implement this

Remake a lot of textures:
Dagger is still using all the old ones
Not very happy with some of the greatblade ones



New weapons to work on:

Scimitar. Weak weapon that focuses on using bleeds to obliterate targets
Boomerang. Self explanatory

Add custom Particles to added weapons

Learn how to do asm:

Cry myself to sleep
Cry some more
Enable option for old tinkers reload for crossbow
Enable option to remove damage cap - library/utils/toolhelper, literally just return whats given
