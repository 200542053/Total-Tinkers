<h1>Total Tinkers: The old and the new, as one.</h1>


Total Tinkers is a mod that aims to add in more to tinkers construct. It aims to add in the 1.7 tinkers weapons, reimagined for 1.12.

Total Tinkers is under the <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license"> MIT License</a>. I don't particularly care what you do, althought it would be cool to know if you use my code.

<h2>TODO:</h2>

Code and package structure is very haphazard. Code needs some significant changes. Remove proxies by version 1.0. Clean up render code.

Implement following weapons:

Proper Javelin behavior
Proper dagger behavior. as of now it is only a meele weapon.
Throwing knives - needs rework. Probably not going to even bother to implement this

Remake a lot of textures:
Dagger is still using all the old ones
Not very happy with some of the greatblade ones

Add sounds and particles to all the weapons

Some new weapons to work on:

Scimitar. Weak weapon that focuses on using bleeds to obliterate targets
Boomerang. Self explanatory
Gunblade: Meele weapon with occasional shooting. Think warframe's high noon bullet guns.
Shield: Battlesign but less battle-ish

Add custom Particles to added weapons

Enable option to remove damage cap - library/utils/toolhelper, literally just return whats given
