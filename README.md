<h1>Total Tinkers: The old and the new, as one.</h1>


Total Tinkers is a mod that aims to add in more to tinkers construct. It aims to add in the 1.7 tinkers weapons, reimagined for 1.12.

Total Tinkers is under the <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license"> MIT License</a>. I don't particularly care what you do, althought it would be cool to know if you use my code.

<h2>TODO:</h2>

Code and package structure is very haphazard. Code needs some significant changes. Remove proxies by version 1.0. Clean up render code.

<h3>Changes to old weapons:</h3>

* Proper Javelin behavior
* Proper dagger behavior. as of now it is only a meele weapon.
* Throwing knives - needs rework. Probably not going to even bother to implement this
* Battleaxe needs the option to use the old behavior
<h3>Remake a lot of textures:</h3>

* Dagger is still using all the old ones

* Not very happy with some of the greatblade ones

* Add sounds and particles to all the weapons

<h3>Some new weapons to work on:</h3>

* Scimitar. Weak weapon that focuses on using bleeds to obliterate targets

* Boomerang. Self explanatory

* Gunblade: Meele weapon with occasional shooting. Think warframe's high noon bullet guns.

* Shield: Battlesign but less battle-ish

* Some alternative to the current bow type weapons.

<h3>Tweaks to implement</h3>

* Enable option to remove damage cap - (library/utils/toolhelper, literally just return whats given)

* Stricter "Two Handed" weapons. 

<h3>QOL:</h3>

* If the stencils that are loot from dungeons are enabled, a tooltip should be added to them.
* Clean up descriptions
* Move location of crafting for some of the weapons
