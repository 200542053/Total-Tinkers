<h1>Total Tinkers: The old and the new, as one.</h1>


Total Tinkers is a mod that aims to add in more to tinkers construct. It aims to add in the 1.7 tinkers weapons, reimagined for 1.12.

Total Tinkers is under the <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license"> MIT License</a>. I don't particularly care what you do, althought it would be cool to see if you use my garbage code.

<h2>TODO:</h2>

Code and package structure is very haphazard. Code needs some significant changes

Implement following weapons:

Proper Javelin behavior
Proper dagger behavior. as of now it is only a meele weapon.
Throwing knives - needs rework. Probably not going to even bother to implement this

Remake a lot of textures:
Dagger is still using all the old ones
Not very happy with some of the greatblade ones

New weapons to work on:

Scimitar. Weak weapon that focuses on using bleeds to obliterate targets
Boomerang. Self explanatory

Add custom Particles to added weapons

Learn how to do asm:

Cry myself to sleep
Cry some more
Enable option for old tinkers reload for crossbow
Enable option to remove damage cap - library/utils/toolhelper, literally just return whats given
